I need to be able to view several files, each corresponding to a different day. (7 maximum).

Each line will be labelled like
'Saturday Nov 10'

And I need to be able to filter the interval that are less than n seconds (typically 30 seconds), so these intervals are ignored.

Last thing, the format of the file is a bit different.
You have something like
Online:8:43:34
Offline:8:45:00

and on the x-axis, only put the labels of the hours
